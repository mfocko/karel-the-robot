 - move from ncurses to s-lang
   - avoid usage of movek() function for Karel's movement because of ncurses move() function
   - or maybe termbox (but no support for windows :-( http://code.google.com/p/termbox/
 - gettext support for error messages
 - SDL support for GUI
   - more interesting ;)
 - support for basic Karel commands only
     - selectively add option to use "batteries included" Karel
